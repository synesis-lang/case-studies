  abstract        = {In the transition toward sustainable energy systems, the co-firing of hydrogen (H2) with natural gas emerges as a critical technology for cleaner power generation. This study examines its benefits, including emissions reduction, enhanced efficiency, and compatibility with existing infrastructure. Concurrently, it addresses the inherent challenges, such as combustion dynamics, necessary infrastructure modifications, and economic considerations. Incorporating global case studies, the review explores recent advancements in hydrogen production and cofiring, evaluating their practicality and operational efficiency. It also provides a critical examination of the economic implications and societal acceptance, which are crucial for the adoption of hydrogen technologies. Moreover, the review investigates the synergy between hydrogen and renewable energy technologies, assessing potential impacts on energy policy and regulation. Ultimately, this comprehensive analysis underscores the essential role of hydrogen co-firing in the energy sector and advocates for a comprehensive strategy that synergizes technological progress, economic viability, regulatory support, and public engagement to promote a resilient and sustainable energy future.},
